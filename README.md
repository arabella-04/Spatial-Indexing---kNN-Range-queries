### Overview

This project consists of three main files:

- `main.py`: This file contains the main function and the core logic of the program.
- `plots.py`: This file contains utility functions to run queries and plot execution times. These functions are called from the `hw1.py` file.
- `interpreter.csv`: The data file required by the program. 
### Installation 

Before running the code, make sure to install all the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

Once the dependencies are installed, the `main.py` file can be run, which contains the main function, by executing the following command.

```bash
